# DiscordOnRepeat
Python script that will make your bot repeat what you say with a simple !repeat command.

DiscordOnRepeat is a Python script which just makes your bot repeat what you say after the !repeat command. Here are the commands you can use:
- !repeat [what to repeat] - Main command. Repeats what is said after !repeat.
- !ping - Use this command to see if bot is working.
- !logout - Logs off the bot. This command can ONLY be used by the owner of the bot. Alternatively, use Ctrl+D in the python window that keeps the bot online.

Requirements:

- A server with your bot in it (obviously)
- Your bot (also obvious)
- All message intents turned on
- Before running open cmd and type in pip install discord.py
- Also remember to edit the .py and replace 'YOUR BOT TOKEN' with your actual bot token
